## Abstract

This document describes a proof of work algorithm that mimics the desirable properties of Bitcoin's consensus algorithm, 
while offering a significant advantage to anyone who can quickly factor 512 bit numbers. 

## Motivation

Cryptographic hash functions are weakened, but not destroyed by quantum computers. In fact, such hash functions are used
as core primitives in the design of post-quantum-cryptographic algorithms, such as [SPHINCS+](https://sphincs.org/). 

Using Grover's algorithm to reverse such hash functions is very impractical, [as it requires hundreds of thousands of gates and thousands of logical qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09383) 
and only provides a quadratic speedup over classical methods. Therefore, we do not expect Grover's algorithm to be used to mine Bitcoin anytime soon. 

However, we would like quantum computers to be able to mine our chain. This embrace of the quantum future, combined with
post-quantum-cryptography, changes the typical predator-prey relationship between quantum computing and blockchain into 
a symbiotic one. Quantum computers will have a valid role in validating our blocks, while the chain remains safe from quantum
attacks.

We accomplish this by embedding an RSA problem into a hash puzzle. A block header is hashed two different ways to create 
a random RSA problem. The result of the hash-to-group operation is done with and without a nonce appended to the header.
These two group elements are fed into SHA3-512 and XORed, with the result interpreted as a distance. If the distance is 
sufficiently small, the nonce is considered a valid solution. The definition of "sufficiently small" is the difficulty 
parameter t, which can be adjusted dynamically as hashrate changes.

With this construction, classical computers can grind on nonces to brute-force a "close enough" solution, while quantum
computers can solve the RSA problem by factoring the modulus n and obtain an exact solution. This distinction between 
solution methods allows us to identify whether a miner has mined a block by factoring n or by brute forcing. In this way, 
the protocol can pay quantum computers to identify themselves and secure the network, acting as a kind of [canary](https://canarytokens.org/nest/) 
for quantum attacks.

## Specification

Python pseudocode below:

```
def get_random_rsa(h): # h is block header
    """
    Generate a pair of coprime numbers deterministically
    from input h.
    """
    m = SHA2_256(h) # m is random 256 bit number derived from header
    n = SHA3_512(h) # n is random 512 bit number
    # Apply SHA3-512 repeatedly until a odd coprime composite is found.
    while m>n or gcd(m,n) != 1 or is_prime(n): 
        n = SHA3_512(n)
    return m, n

def f(h, s):
    m, n = get_random_rsa(h)
    result = pow(m, h + s, n) # m^(h+s) mod n
    return SHA3_512(result)
    
def valid_solution(h, s, t):
    if s == 0:
        return False
    original = f(h, 0)
    solution = f(h, s)
    # XOR original and solution and interpret as distance
    distance = original ^ solution 
    return distance <= t
```


## Reference Implementation

We implement this feature [here](https://gitlab.com/quantus-network/backbone/-/tree/main/pallets/qpow?ref_type=heads).


## Rationale

We repeatedly hash the header because there are some pathological cases we want to avoid. 

- if n is less than m, we consider the group size to be excessively small (<= 256 bits)
- if n shares a factor with m, this eliminates exact solutions, by [Bezout's Theorem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BezoutsTheorem.html)
- if n is prime, the problem is trivial to solve with s + h = n-1 by [Fermat's Little Theorem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FermatsLittleTheorem.html)

An exact solution (where f(h, 0) == f(h, s)) is [obtained](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulersTotientTheorem.html) 
by computing [Euler's Totient Function](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotientFunction.html) which requires factoring n to compute.

The hardness of "reversing" a correct solution without factoring n follows from the hardness of reversing the final SHA3-512.
Essentially, finding two distinct preimages for which their digests are "close enough" is computationally difficult because it 
reduces to the [second-preimage problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack) for the set of close-enough digests, 
of which there are approximately 2t: \[f(h, 0) - t, f(h, 0) + t\]
