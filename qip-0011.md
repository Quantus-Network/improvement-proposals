## Abstract

This document describes a security protocol built on top of reversible transactions in which reversal periods are mandatory 
and a separate account is assigned the role of "interceptor" and has the exclusive privilege to reverse transactions.

## Motivation

Security and convenience are naturally in tension with one another. The simple rules of blockchain transfers enable both
legitimate and fraudulent users to easily send money without fear of reversal. Anyone who steals a private key or gains 
control of a signer can send funds and the legitimate owner is generally powerless to stop it. 

A high-security account puts a mandatory reversal period on all transfers that take money from the account. This gives the 
interceptor time to react. The interceptor is a separate account (preferably higher-security, hardware wallet, multisig, etc.)
that has the exclusive right to cancel the transaction and take custody of the funds. 

This structure mimics the traditional financial system which can force transfer from a bank account given a court order.
The difference is that users can opt in to this system and choose their own interceptor, which could be a wallet they control, 
some trusted third party, or even another high-security account. This makes the protocol composable, enabling arbitrary 
hierarchies of keys with the interceptor having superior permissions to the high-security account.

## Specification

This protocol builds on top of [reversible transfers (QIP-0010)](qip-0010.md). Users can opt in to make their account 
high security. This action is permanent and requires them to specify the mandatory reversal period and an interceptor account. 
The interceptor account can be any kind of account, including another high-security account and/or a multisig. 

When [cancel_transfer](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/blob/main/pallets/reversible-transfers/src/lib.rs#L702) 
is called the chain requires the caller to be the interceptor. 

## Reference Implementation

High security accounts are implemented [here](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/blob/main/pallets/reversible-transfers/src/lib.rs#L312) .

## Rationale

Setting an account as high-security cannot be turned off to prevent a thief from turning it off. The interceptor is expected
to be another account from a different seed phrase, preferably better secured than the high-security account.
