## Abstract

This document describes the integration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into the libp2p networking stack used by the Quantus Network. The implementation adds support for Dilithium signatures and ML-KEM key encapsulation mechanisms to provide quantum-resistant peer identity and transport security.

## Motivation

The existing libp2p stack relies on classical cryptographic algorithms that are vulnerable to quantum attacks via Shor's algorithm. As quantum computers advance, the need for quantum-resistant networking protocols becomes critical for long-term security. This QIP documents the modifications made to three core networking components to support post-quantum cryptography:

1. **libp2p-identity**: Peer identity and authentication using quantum-resistant signatures
2. **libp2p-noise**: Transport layer security using quantum-resistant key exchange
3. **sc-network**: Substrate networking layer with PQC support

The goal is to provide a migration path from classical to post-quantum cryptography while maintaining compatibility with existing libp2p networks during the transition period.

## Specification

### libp2p-identity-pqc

**Dilithium Signature Support**

- Added support for NIST-standardized Dilithium (ML-DSA-87) signatures
- Integrated with existing keypair generation and management infrastructure
- Default keypair type changed from Ed25519 to Dilithium for quantum resistance

**Key Features:**
- Dilithium keypair generation with 32-byte entropy input
- Signature creation and verification using ML-DSA-87 parameters
- Protobuf encoding/decoding for network serialization
- Peer ID derivation from Dilithium public keys

**Protocol Buffer Extension:**
```protobuf
enum KeyType {
  RSA = 0;
  Ed25519 = 1;
  Secp256k1 = 2;
  ECDSA = 3;
  Dilithium = 4;  // New post-quantum key type
}
```

### libp2p-noise-pqc

**ML-KEM Key Encapsulation**

- Integrated ML-KEM768 (NIST-standardized) for key agreement
- Extended Noise Protocol Framework to support post-quantum handshakes

**Key Features:**
- ML-KEM768 keypair generation for quantum-resistant key exchange
- Extended handshake protocol with additional KEM message exchange
- Configurable post-quantum mode (enabled by default when `ml-kem` feature is active)
- Backward compatibility with classical X25519 handshakes

**Handshake Protocol Extension:**
```
Classical:  -> e, s, es, ss
Post-Quantum: -> e, s, es, ss, kem_final
```

The post-quantum handshake adds a fourth message containing the final KEM exchange to establish quantum-resistant shared secrets.

### sc-network-pqc

**Substrate Network Layer PQC Support**

- Modified Substrate's networking layer to use post-quantum libp2p components
- Default node key generation switched to Dilithium
- Configuration options for both classical and post-quantum key types

**Key Features:**
- `NodeKeyConfig::Dilithium` for post-quantum node identity
- Automatic Dilithium keypair generation for new nodes
- File-based key persistence for Dilithium keys
- Runtime configuration between Ed25519 and Dilithium key types

## Implementation Details

### Dependency Management

**libp2p-identity-pqc:**
```toml
[dependencies]
rusty-crystals-dilithium = { git = "https://github.com/quantus-network/rusty-crystals.git" }

[features]
default = ["dilithium"]
dilithium = ["dep:rusty-crystals-dilithium", "dep:zeroize", "dep:sha2", "dep:hkdf", "rand", "peerid"]
```

**libp2p-noise-pqc:**
```toml
[features]
default = ["ml-kem"]
ml-kem = []
```

**sc-network-pqc:**
```toml
[dependencies.libp2p-identity]
git = "https://github.com/Quantus-Network/libp2p-identity-pqc"
features = ["dilithium"]
```

### Key Size Considerations

| Algorithm | Public Key Size | Private Key Size | Signature Size |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Ed25519   | 32 bytes       | 32 bytes         | 64 bytes       |
| Dilithium | 2592 bytes     | 4864 bytes       | 4595 bytes     |
| X25519    | 32 bytes       | 32 bytes         | N/A            |
| ML-KEM768 | 1184 bytes     | 2400 bytes       | 1088 bytes     |

The post-quantum algorithms require significantly more storage and bandwidth, but provide quantum resistance.

### Security Parameters

**Dilithium (ML-DSA-87):**
- Security Level: NIST Level 5 (256-bit classical, 128-bit quantum)
- Based on Module Learning With Errors (M-LWE) problem
- Standardized in FIPS 204

**ML-KEM768:**
- Security Level: NIST Level 3 (192-bit classical, 96-bit quantum)
- Based on Module Learning With Errors (M-LWE) problem
- Standardized in FIPS 203

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility through:

1. **Feature Flags**: PQC support is enabled via Cargo features, allowing selective compilation
2. **Runtime Configuration**: Nodes can be configured to use either classical or post-quantum algorithms
3. **Protocol Negotiation**: The Noise handshake protocol automatically detects and uses appropriate algorithms


## Performance Considerations

**Computational Overhead:**
- Dilithium signatures: ~2-3x slower than Ed25519
- ML-KEM operations: ~10-15x slower than X25519
- Memory usage: ~50-100x increase due to larger key sizes

**Network Overhead:**
- Increased handshake message sizes due to larger public keys
- Higher bandwidth requirements for signature verification
- Additional handshake round for post-quantum key exchange

## Reference Implementation

The complete implementation is available across three repositories:

- **libp2p-identity-pqc**: [https://github.com/Quantus-Network/libp2p-identity-pqc](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/libp2p-identity-pqc)
- **libp2p-noise-pqc**: [https://github.com/Quantus-Network/libp2p-noise-pqc](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/libp2p-noise-pqc)
- **sc-network-pqc**: [https://github.com/Quantus-Network/sc-network-pqc](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/sc-network-pqc)

The implementation depends on the Dilithium and ML-KEM algorithms provided by the [rusty-crystals](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/rusty-crystals) library, which implements the NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.

## Rationale

**Algorithm Selection:**

- **Dilithium**: Chosen for its NIST standardization, conservative security parameters, and reasonable performance characteristics
- **ML-KEM768**: Selected for its balance between security level and performance, providing adequate quantum resistance for key exchange


**Default Configuration:**

- Post-quantum algorithms are enabled by default
