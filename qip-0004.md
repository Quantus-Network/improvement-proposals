## Abstract

This document describes the integration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into the libp2p networking stack used by the Quantus Network. 
The implementation adds support for Dilithium (ML-DSA) signatures and Kyber (ML-KEM) key encapsulation mechanisms to provide 
quantum-resistant peer identity and transport security.

## Motivation

The existing libp2p stack relies on classical cryptographic algorithms that are vulnerable to quantum attacks via Shor's algorithm. 
As quantum computers advance, the need for quantum-resistant networking protocols becomes critical for long-term security. 
This QIP documents the modifications made to three core networking components to support post-quantum cryptography:

1. **libp2p-identity**: Peer identity and authentication using quantum-resistant signatures
2. **libp2p-noise**: Transport layer security using quantum-resistant key exchange
3. **sc-network**: Substrate networking layer with PQC support

## Specification

### libp2p-identity-pqc

**Dilithium Signature Support**
- Added support for [ML-DSA-87](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final) signatures
- Integrated with existing keypair generation and management infrastructure
- Default keypair type changed from Ed25519 to Dilithium for quantum resistance
- Dilithium keypair generation with 32-byte entropy input
- Protobuf encoding/decoding for network serialization
- Peer ID derivation from Dilithium public keys

**Protocol Buffer Extension:**
```protobuf
enum KeyType {
  RSA = 0;
  Ed25519 = 1;
  Secp256k1 = 2;
  ECDSA = 3;
  Dilithium = 4;  // New post-quantum key type
}
```

### libp2p-noise-pqc

**ML-KEM Key Encapsulation**

- Integrated [ML-KEM768](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final) for key agreement
- Extended Noise Protocol Framework to support post-quantum handshakes
- ML-KEM768 keypair generation for quantum-resistant key exchange
- Extended handshake protocol with additional KEM message exchange
- Configurable post-quantum mode (enabled by default when `ml-kem` feature is active)
- Backward compatibility with classical X25519 handshakes

**Handshake Protocol Extension:**
```
Classical:  -> e, s, es, ss
Post-Quantum: -> e, s, es, ss, kem_final
```

[The post-quantum handshake adds a fourth message containing the final KEM exchange to establish quantum-resistant shared secrets.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3560577)

### sc-network-pqc

**Substrate Network Layer PQC Support**

- Modified Substrate's networking layer to use post-quantum libp2p components
- Default node key generation switched to Dilithium
- Configuration options for both classical and post-quantum key types
- `NodeKeyConfig::Dilithium` enum for post-quantum node identity
- File-based key persistence for Dilithium keys
- Runtime configuration between Ed25519 and Dilithium key types

## Implementation Details

### Dependency Management

**libp2p-identity-pqc:**
```toml
[dependencies]
rusty-crystals-dilithium = { git = "https://github.com/quantus-network/rusty-crystals.git" }

[features]
default = ["dilithium"]
dilithium = ["dep:rusty-crystals-dilithium", "dep:zeroize", "dep:sha2", "dep:hkdf", "rand", "peerid"]
```

**libp2p-noise-pqc:**
```toml
[features]
default = ["ml-kem"]
ml-kem = []
```

**sc-network-pqc:**
```toml
[dependencies.libp2p-identity]
git = "https://github.com/Quantus-Network/libp2p-identity-pqc"
features = ["dilithium"]
```

### Key Size Considerations

| Algorithm | Public Key Size | Private Key Size | Payload Size |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Ed25519   | 32 bytes       | 32 bytes         | 64 bytes     |
| ML-DSA-87 | 2592 bytes     | 4864 bytes       | 4627 bytes   |
| ML-KEM768 | 1184 bytes     | 2400 bytes       | 1088 bytes   |

The [post-quantum](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/docs/algorithms/sig/dilithium.md) [algorithms](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/docs/algorithms/kem/ml_kem.md) 
require significantly more storage and bandwidth, but provide quantum resistance.

### Security Parameters

**Dilithium (ML-DSA-87):**
- Security Level: NIST Level 5 (256-bit classical, 128-bit quantum)
- Based on Module Learning With Errors (M-LWE) problem
- Standardized in FIPS 204

**ML-KEM768:**
- Security Level: NIST Level 3 (192-bit classical, 96-bit quantum)
- Based on Module Learning With Errors (M-LWE) problem
- Standardized in FIPS 203

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility through:

1. **Feature Flags**: PQC support is enabled via Cargo features, allowing selective compilation
2. **Runtime Configuration**: Nodes can be configured to use either classical or post-quantum algorithms
3. **Protocol Negotiation**: The Noise handshake protocol automatically detects and uses appropriate algorithms


## Performance Considerations

**Computational Overhead:**
- Dilithium signatures: [~7-10x slower signing than Ed25519](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/) and [similar verification times to Ed25519](https://s.itho.me/ccms_slides/2024/5/23/4414254e-124d-4bbd-8a41-579706b59401.pdf)
- ML-KEM operations: [similar encapsulation and decapsulation times](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/) and [~18x increase in memory size due to larger key sizes](https://labs.apnic.net/index.php/2024/11/27/post-quantum-cryptography/)

**Network Overhead:**
- Increased handshake message sizes due to larger public keys
- Higher cpu requirements for signature verification
- Additional handshake round for post-quantum key exchange

## Reference Implementation

The complete implementation is available across three repositories:

- **libp2p-identity-pqc**: [https://github.com/Quantus-Network/libp2p-identity-pqc](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/libp2p-identity-pqc)
- **libp2p-noise-pqc**: [https://github.com/Quantus-Network/libp2p-noise-pqc](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/libp2p-noise-pqc)
- **sc-network-pqc**: [https://github.com/Quantus-Network/sc-network-pqc](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/sc-network-pqc)

The implementation depends on the Dilithium algorithms provided by the [rusty-crystals](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/rusty-crystals) and Kyber for noise from [clatter](https://crates.io/crates/clatter)

## Rationale

**Algorithm Selection:**
- **ML-DSA-87**: Chosen for its NIST standardization, conservative security parameters, and reasonable performance characteristics
- **ML-KEM-768**: Selected for its balance between security level and performance, providing adequate quantum resistance for key exchange

The security of p2p connections in a blockchain is important, but failure of their cryptography is not catastrophic. 
Specifically, if a node's libp2p keys were compromised, the attacker could impersonate nodes or decrypt communication between nodes. 

Nodes are already assumed to be possibly malicious and are therefore generally untrusted in the blockchain security model. 
Invalid transactions will not be included regardless of who sent them. Transactions are signed by users, not nodes, and 
nodes will eventually drop peers that misbehave. A large scale attacker could potentially knock many nodes off the network
by impersonating them and sending invalid messages, which is why we choose the highest security setting for this.

Decrypting p2p communication does not confer tremendous benefits to the attacker, as the messages passed among
the nodes generally make it on chain eventually and are therefore expected to be public. The primary benefit to the attacker
would be that they could track a given transaction's path thru the network, potentially narrowing down the geography or 
IP address of the owner of a particular key. This attack is unlikely to be carried out by anyone other than a state actor
and is defeated by users connecting to the network thru proxies, VPNs or Tor. Therefore, we choose the medium security level (768)
for ML-KEM.
