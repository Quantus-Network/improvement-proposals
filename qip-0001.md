==What is a QIP?==

QIP stands for Quantus Improvement Proposal. A QIP is a design document providing information to the Quantus community, or describing a new feature for Quantus or its processes or environment. The QIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend QIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Quantus. The QIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the QIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

==QIP Types==

There are three kinds of QIP:

* A Standards Track QIP describes any change that affects most or all Quantus implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Quantus.
* An Informational QIP describes a Quantus design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Quantus community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational QIPs do not necessarily represent a Quantus community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational QIPs or follow their advice.
* A Process QIP describes a process surrounding Quantus, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process QIPs are like Standards Track QIPs but apply to areas other than the Quantus protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Quantus's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational QIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Quantus development. Any meta-QIP is also considered a Process QIP.

==QIP Work Flow==

The QIP process begins with a new idea for Quantus. Each potential QIP must have a champion -- someone who writes the QIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The QIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is QIP-able. Posting to the (TODO: where?) is the best way to go about this.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a QIP is meant to save both the potential author and the wider community time. Many ideas have been brought forward for changing Quantus that have been rejected for various reasons. Asking the Quantus community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Quantus is used. Small enhancements or patches often don't need standardisation between multiple projects; these don't need a QIP and should be injected into the relevant Quantus development work flow with a patch submission to the applicable Quantus issue tracker.

Once the champion has asked the Quantus community as to whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft QIP should be presented to (TODO: where?). This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft QIP to make it properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns about the proposal. Following a discussion, the proposal should be sent to the QIP editor with the draft QIP. This draft must be written in QIP style as described below, else it will be sent back without further regard until proper formatting rules are followed.

QIP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on both the initial idea and the QIP before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on public forums should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the QIP author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page or git repository, etc. QIP authors should use their discretion here.

It is highly recommended that a single QIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the QIP, the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your QIP into several well-focused ones.

The QIP editors assign QIP numbers and change their status. Please send all QIP-related email to the QIP editor, which is listed under [[#QIP_Editors|QIP Editors]] below. Also see [[#QIP_Editor_Responsibilities__Workflow|QIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow]]. The QIP editor reserves the right to reject QIP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too broad.

Authors MUST NOT self assign QIP numbers, but should use an alias such as "qip-johndoe-infiniterez" which includes the author's name/nick and the QIP subject.

If the QIP editor approves, he will assign the QIP a number, label it as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, give it status "Draft", and add it to the QIPs git repository. The QIP editor will not unreasonably deny a QIP. Reasons for denying QIP status include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the Quantus philosophy. For a QIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

The QIP author may update the Draft as necessary in the git repository. Updates to drafts may also be submitted by the author as pull requests.

Standards Track QIPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation. The QIP should be reviewed and accepted before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference implementation will aid people in studying the QIP. Standards Track QIPs must include an implementation -- in the form of code, a patch, or a URL to same -- before it can be considered Final.

Once a QIP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be completed. When the reference implementation is complete and accepted by the community, the status will be changed to "Final".

A QIP can also be assigned status "Deferred". The QIP author or editor can assign the QIP this status when no progress is being made on the QIP. Once a QIP is deferred, the QIP editor can re-assign it to draft status.

A QIP can also be "Rejected". Perhaps after all is said and done it was not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this fact.

QIPs can also be superseded by a different QIP, rendering the original obsolete. This is intended for Informational QIPs, where version 2 of an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the status of QIPs are as follows:

<img src=qip-0001/QIP-0001-1.png></img>

Some Informational and Process QIPs may also have a status of "Active" if they are never meant to be completed. E.g. QIP 1 (this QIP).

==What belongs in a successful QIP?==

Each QIP should have the following parts:

* Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the QIP, including the QIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact info for each author, etc.

* Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

* Copyright/public domain -- Each QIP must either be explicitly labelled as placed in the public domain (see this QIP as an example) or licensed under the Open Publication License.

* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for QIPs that want to change the Quantus protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the QIP solves. QIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

* The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

* Backwards Compatibility -- All QIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The QIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. QIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

* Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be completed before any QIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the QIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code.

* The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the Quantus protocol.

==QIP Formats and Templates==

QIPs should be written in markdown format.

===QIP Header Preamble===

Each QIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

<pre>
  QIP: <QIP number>
  Title: <QIP title>
  Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
* Discussions-To: <email address>
  Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
           Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
  Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
  Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
* Post-History: <dates of postings to (TODO: where?) >
* Replaces: <QIP number>
* Superseded-By: <QIP number>
* Resolution: <url>
</pre>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of all the authors/owners of the QIP. The format of the Author header value must be

Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

Random J. User

if the address is not given.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.

Note: The Resolution header is required for Standards Track QIPs only. It contains a URL that should point to an email message or other web resource where the pronouncement about the QIP is made.

While a QIP is in private discussions (usually during the initial Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the QIP is being discussed. No Discussions-To header is necessary if the QIP is being discussed privately with the author, or on the QIP wiki.

The Type header specifies the type of QIP: Standards Track, Informational, or Process.

The Created header records the date that the QIP was assigned a number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new versions of the QIP are posted to (TODO: where?). Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

QIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the QIP numbers that this QIP depends on.

QIPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a QIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the QIP that replaces the current document. The newer QIP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the QIP that it rendered obsolete.

===Auxiliary Files===

QIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Image files should be included in a subdirectory for that QIP. Auxiliary files must be named QIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where "XXXX" is the QIP number, "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").

==Transferring QIP Ownership==

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of QIPs to a new champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred QIP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the QIP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the QIP. We try to build consensus around a QIP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing QIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a QIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the QIP editor. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the QIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).

==QIP Editors==

The current QIP editor is Chris Smith who can be contacted at [[mailto:chris@quantusnetwork.io]].

==QIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow==

The QIP editor subscribes to the Quantus development mailing list. All QIP-related correspondence should be sent (or CC'd) to chris@quantusnetwork.io

For each new QIP that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the QIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* Edit the QIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (for reST QIPs), code style.

If the QIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the QIP is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a "pull request" to the [https://gitlab.com/quantus-network/improvement-proposals] repository on GitLab where it may get further feedback.

The QIP editor will:

* Assign a QIP number (almost always just the next available number, but sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141) in the pull request comments.

* Merge the pull request when the author is ready (allowing some time for further peer review).

* List the QIP in [[README.md]]

* Send email back to the QIP author with next steps.

The QIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The QIP editors monitor QIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

==History==

This document was essentially copied from Quantus's QIP-0001, which was derived heavily from Python's PEP-0001. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they are not responsible for its use in the Quantus Improvement Process, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Quantus or the QIP process. Please direct all comments to the QIP editors or the Quantus development team (TODO: where?).
