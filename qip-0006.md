## Abstract

This document describes how to use lattice cryptography for signatures in Substrate. 

## Motivation

Quantum computers can run [Schor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's_algorithm), and if they reach a sufficient
size, they will be able to derive elliptic curve private keys from public keys, which must be broadcast to the network
so that consensus can verify signatures. The future is post-quantum and requires us to use post-quantum-cryptography to 
protect the integrity of our new financial system.

## Specification

Integrating with Substrate mostly amounts to implementing the Pair and IdentifyAccount and some [other small traits](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/blob/main/dilithium-crypto/src/traits.rs) 
for the relevant abstractions. [The structs](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/blob/main/dilithium-crypto/src/types.rs) 
are just wrappers around private keys, public keys and/or signatures. We currently only support ML-DSA-87 (largest key size), 
but this can be extended in the future.

## Reference Implementation

For keygen, signing and verification we use https://github.com/Quantus-Network/rusty-crystals, which is derived from an
implementation of ml-dsa borrowed from [Quantum Blockchain's port](https://github.com/Quantum-Blockchains/dilithium)
of [pq-crystals](https://github.com/pq-crystals/dilithium) to Rust. We check that the NIST Known-Answer-Tests work with 
our code [here](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/rusty-crystals/blob/master/tests/verify_integration_test.rs#L16) and 
we also fuzz them to confirm that editing breaks verification.

The signatures are integrated into the chain [here](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/tree/main/dilithium-crypto)

## Rationale

We chose ML-DSA (formerly dilithium) signatures over FN-DSA (formerly falcon) because

- FN-DSA is more complex to implement correctly
- FN-DSA uses floating point numbers
- FN-DSA does not have deterministic keygen in the specification (see [QIP-0002](./qip-0002.md))
- FN-DSA has not yet been finalized at the time of this publication

The drawback is that ML-DSA keys and signatures are [significantly bigger](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/main/docs/algorithms/sig)
than those of FN-DSA. We use the largest key sizes because 

- Lattice cryptography is newer and less battle-tested, so if there are breakthroughs in cryptoanalysis of lattice problems, they will likely affect smaller key sizes first
- The network is new, so storage is not currently a bottleneck
- Our [entangled addresses](./qip-0005.md) will address the scaling issue with zero-knowledge-proofs

[SLH-DSA](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final) was another option, but the signatures are even larger (17KB+). We 
may support it in the future.
