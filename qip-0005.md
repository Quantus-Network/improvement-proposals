## Abstract

This document describes an aggregated post-quantum signature scheme for blockchains using zero-knowledge proofs. 
It moves balance-verification off-chain so that on-chain verification simply has to verify a single proof and update balances. 
It uses provably-unspendable addresses and nullifiers to prevent double-spends and storage-proofs to prove that funding took place. 
These signatures can be aggregated because the proof system we use [plonky2](qip-0005/QIP-0005-2.pdf) supports aggregation. This allows an essentially 
unlimited number of transactions to be represented in a single proof. The public inputs 
(nullifiers, storage_roots, exit_addresses, exit_amounts) then become the limiting factor, with ~256 additional bytes per transaction. 

We call this scheme "entangled addresses" because the unspendable addresses and exit addresses are invisibly linked, like
entangled qubits. 

## Motivation

Transitioning to a post-quantum era in blockchains introduces a scaling challenge because post-quantum signatures and public keys
are many times larger than those of elliptic curves and these typically need to be revealed to make a transaction. Secure hash 
algorithms (poseidon in our case) are generally weakened but not destroyed by quantum algorithms (specifically Grover's). 
In fact, some post-quantum signature schemes such as SPHINCS+ are built on top of the security of secure hash functions,
so proving knowledge of a preimage can suffice as a post-quantum signature scheme.

### Client / Prover Flow

User generates what appears to be a normal account but is provably unspendable. The account is unspendable because, 
instead of being a single-hash of a public key like a normal account, it is the double-hash of a salt + secret. The salt + double 
hashing protects the system from false-positives, where the zk-proof is convinced that the account is unspendable but actually
the digest is a single-hash of a public key and therefore spendable. The security of the construction therefore reduces 
to finding the preimage of a preimage of a digest.

Users retain this proof of unspendability (secret pre-image) for later claims. Any tokens that are sent to the address 
are therefore provably burned, and so they can be re-minted without changing the total token supply. Each transfer of tokens
to the address generates a [TransferProof](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/blob/main/pallets/balances/src/lib.rs#L579) storage object. The user's wallet can generate a storage proof for each 
transfer. This storage proof is a merkle-patricia-trie (MPT) proof from a recent storage root (stored in block header) down to 
a specific storage item (TransferProof in this case). The MPT proof is similar to a Merkle proof, except that instead of 
each parent being the hash of the children, the hash of each child is part of the parent's data. 

The TransferProof contains various data about the transfer, including the global count of such TransferProofs, which makes
each TransferProof unique. This global count is included in the nullifier preimage along with a salt and the users secret.

The secret used to create both the nullifier and the unspendable-account must be retained by the wallet and should therefore 
be derived deterministically from the wallet seed, similar to private/public keys.


### Aggregator Flow

Anyone can aggregate the proofs and submit the resulting aggregated-proof to the chain. The aggregator can be the client,
a miner or some untrusted third party. The aggregator takes a set of proofs with their public inputs and generates an 
aggregated proof via plonky2 recursion. The public inputs of the leaves are passed thru in the following manner:

- Nullifiers are passed unchanged
- Duplicate storage-roots are deduplicated
- Duplicate exit-addresses are deduplicated
- Exit-amounts of duplicate exit-addresses are summed

The deduplication and summing reduce the storage requirements for the chain. This aggregation process can be recursed, 
so that the many proofs being aggregated become leaves in a tree.


### Chain / Verifier Flow

The chain / verifier receives a possibly-aggregated proof and must check the following:
- Each storage root is real, i.e. that it was included in some recent block header
- Each nullifier has never been used before
- The supplied proof is valid

### Circuit Logic

The zk-circuit verifies three things: 

- The storage proof
- That the nullifier was computed correctly `nullifier = H(H(salt + secret + global_transfer_count))`
- That the unspendable address is indeed unspendable

Unspendable addresses can be re-used because the nullifier will be different for different transfers, and the secret will be retained.


### Performance

In the case that a user is aggregating their own transactions with all storage proofs acquired relative to the same storage,
this could result in a tremendous improvement on storage requirements per transaction, with only an additional nullifier
required for each additional transaction. If we have 5MB blocks and the plonky2 proofs are ~100KB, then we could have 
4.9MB / 32B = 153,125 transactions included in one block, compared to the 5MB / 7.3KB = 685 dilithium transactions. 

### Security Notes

- Faulty proof verification or circuit implementation could create an inflation bug
- Users could prove an address is entangled by publishing the first hash `H(salt + secret)`
- Verification transactions will be [unsigned](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/knowledgebase/blob/master/current/learn-substrate/extrinsics.md)
- Peculiarities in the MPT mean that the 32 byte leaf-hash does not always appear in full in the storage proof. As a tradeoff, we check only the last three felts (24 bytes), this gives ~96 bits of security for a preimage attack

### Economic Notes

- The total supply of coins must be calculated via validator rewards, as entangled address spends appear to create new coins. We do this in Substrate by using the functions [`increase_balance` and `withdraw`](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/blob/main/pallets/wormhole/src/lib.rs) to re-mint the coins and deduct fees.
- An inflation bug due to a faulty implementation would be economically-detectable only if the amount of reminted coins exceeded the sum of the balances of addresses that have 0 sends from them.

## Reference Implementation

We implement the circuit [here](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/zk-circuits), and connect the verifier to the chain [here](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/blob/main/pallets/wormhole/src/lib.rs).

## Rationale

We use plonky2 as the proving system because...
- it uses FRI (from STARKs), which is post-quantum
- no trusted setup
- very efficient proving and verification
- easy proof aggregation
- rust-native
- reasonably easy to [get verifier](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/plonky2) into no-std state for Substrate

The nullifier construction uses `H(H(salt + secret + global_transfer_counter))`, which prevents double-spending while allowing address reuse across different transactions.

The use of double hashing (`H(H(salt+secret))`) allows users to prove an address is entangled without revealing the secret. In particular, dilithium public keys are much larger
than 32 bytes, so a 32 byte preimage of an address could not be a dilithium pubkey.
