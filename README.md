# Quantus Improvement Proposals (QIPs)

This repository contains the Quantus Improvement Proposals (QIPs) - design documents that specify upgrades and changes to the Quantus Network. QIPs document how our chain has deviated from the original Substrate solochain template and serve as the formal process for proposing new features and improvements.

## What are QIPs?

QIPs are design documents providing information to the Quantus community or describing new features for the Quantus Network. Each QIP should provide a concise technical specification and rationale for the proposed feature.

## Current QIPs

- **QIP-0001**: QIP Purpose and Guidelines - Defines the QIP process and formatting standards
- **QIP-0002**: Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets For Lattice Keys - Post-quantum HD wallet implementation
- **QIP-0003**: RSA-Shortcut Proof of Work - Hybrid classical/quantum mining algorithm

## Contributing

To propose a new QIP, please follow the guidelines outlined in [QIP-0001](qip-0001.md). All QIPs should be submitted as pull requests for community review and discussion.
