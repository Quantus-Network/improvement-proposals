## Abstract

This document describes a [modification](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/zk-trie) to the [merkle-patricia-trie](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/primitives/trie) used for storage in Substrate.
The storage proofs are modified so that each datatype is field-element (felt) aligned, allowing us to easily reason about
the different fields in the storage proof in a zk-circuit without doing complex binary analysis.

## Motivation

ZK-Proof systems are a highly-opinionated computing platform that allow for efficient remote verification that a computation was
done correctly. This acts as a kind of [compression on computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlMpAbZOC0), which we 
[use for scaling post-quantum signatures](./qip-0005.md). We say it is highly-opinionated because it has a fundamental 
data type of a [field element](https://rareskills.io/post/finite-fields), rather than bytes as most platforms use. 

This makes certain computations efficient and others very inefficient. In particular, Substrate's storage proofs are 
[not zk friendly](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/generalized-storage-proofs/1315). The optimizations made to make them
space-efficient results in greater parsing complexity and variable-length data fields. 

We address this by reducing the space-efficiency and making each field be felt-aligned. Since we use plonky2, this makes
them aligned to 8 byte boundaries.

## Specification

We pad everything to 8 bytes. Specifically, we pad
- Node Headers
- Bitmaps
- Nibbles
- Values
- Children

We also do not allow inlining child data. Instead, every child is represented in teh parent by its hash, which was already 
done for large enough children.

## Reference Implementation

The zk-trie is implemented [here](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/zk-trie)

## Rationale

Verifying Merkle-Patricia-Trie proofs is similar to verifying Merkle proofs, but instead of each parent being the hash of
the children, the hash of each child is included in the parent's data. These hashes are felts, so if the index of the 
child hash in the parent data is felt-aligned the circuit can simply check 4 pairs of felts for equality. However, in Substrate's
storage proofs, the child hash is not guaranteed to be felt-aligned, which then requires complex gymnastics to reason about.
The child hashes are stored close to the end of the proof-node, so their position is influenced by the length of all values in 
the proof-node. Therefore, to felt-align the child hash, we must felt-align everything that comes before it.
